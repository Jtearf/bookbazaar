## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was created as part of my journey transitioning from a Junior Solution Architect into a Full Stack Developer.

It is intended to showcase:

- My ability to architect and implement full stack applications
- Practical use of modern web technologies
- Real-world developer workflow using Git, VS Code, and GitHub

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### 🔙 Backend – Django + Django REST Framework

- Python 3.13.3
- Django 5.2.1
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL (can be swapped with SQLite for development)
- Django CORS Headers (for frontend-backend communication)

### 🔜 Frontend – React

- React (with functional components and hooks)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML/CSS (basic styling)
- Fetch API (for REST calls)

### 🧪 Tools

- VS Code (IDE)
- Git & GitHub (version control)
- Postman (for testing API endpoints)
- pgAdmin / SQLite Browser (database visualization)
